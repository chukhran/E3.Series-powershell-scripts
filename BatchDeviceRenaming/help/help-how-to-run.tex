\startsection[title= How to run the script]

The script can be launched in several ways:

\startitemize
\item as an external script from the console window
\item as an Add-on from \E\

\startsubsection[title=Launching the script in the console window]
The script can be launched either from {\unhyphenated\it Windows~PowerShell~ISE} or the console window.

They're the easiest ways but are not always convenient.

\startsubsection[title=Launcher for PowerShell scripts]
PowerShell is a task automation solution made up of a command-line shell, a scripting language. When the ps-script is launching, a console window shows up always even using the keys \type{powershell.exe -WindowStyle Hidden -NoLogo ... }. In the last case, a console window will still flash.

To hide a console window, PowerShell has to be launched through a process that does not itself have a console window. It is known that WSH scripts do not have a console window, so VBScript can be used to launch \type{powershell.exe} in a hidden window.

It was created \type{launcher.vbs} script to run {\unhyphenated\type{BatchDeviceRenaming.ps1}} script as an Add-on of {\E}.
