{\bf Batch Device Renaming} is a PowerShell script for batch processing used to rename selected devices in \E\ to save time and reduce the amount of work involved. Renaming is done according to the definition of the new name mask. Instead of \type{*} and \type{?} wildcards, this script uses placeholders in brackets \type{[ ]}. Placeholders can be combined with each other.

Devices can be selected in both the Devices tree panel and/or a sheet.

A preview of new names is immediately shown in the status bar of the script window, but the devices are not renamed until the {\bf Rename} button is pressed.
